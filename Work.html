    <h4>2018-Present</h4>
    <h2> Designing a deployment console for smart-contract-powered distributed applications</h2></span>

    <span class="brief col-1">
        <h3>Problem/Opportunity:</h3>
           <p> Digital Asset offers Daml, a platform for developing multi-party distributed applications. While developing 
               multiple proofs of concept for clients, and observing users getting started with the Daml platform, we found 
               a unique opportunity to provide a fully managed cloud environment to enable our customers to get to market much 
               quicker by skipping over having to construct and maintain their own infrastracture.</p>
           
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
          <p>A lean team was built internally to develop this idea. I helped drive a lot of the initial discussions to define 
              the target persona, and value proposition for this new project. Over time, I lead design for the information 
              architecture and user interface of the offering. I was able to work extremely closely with engineers and even 
              help with implementation and visual styling in code. Today, I continue to conduct research and iteration to 
              support the growth and evolution of the product in the market. Here are some of the main takeaways from this project so far:</p>

        <h3>Information Architecture that supports the users mental model and the local developer experience</h3>
        <p>Throughout this project, a robust and thoroughly maintained information architecture map has been crucial for developing a tool that users can immediately recognize and be productive with. Conducting research and stakeholder interviews to understand the Daml stack, the local developer experience and common patterns that developers are used to informed the decisions that were made to establish where information is located and arranged within the digital space.</p>

        <h3>Prototyping - From paper to code</h3>
        <p>From low fidelity sketches to communicate high level ideas, to high fidelity mock-ups for validating our approach through rapid testing. When we had high confidence in a solution to a problem, developers and I simply collaborated in code.</p>

        <h3>Responsive and accessible design</h3>
        <p>The platform was buit to be fully responsive to support users in a variety of contexts. The design system, navigation patterns and interaction models established over time comply with WCAG 2.0 requirements to ensure the tool is accessible to all.</p>

        <h3>Watson for Oncology</h3>
    <p>Watson for Oncology is a clinical decision support tool that aggregates and analyzes data from published medical literature, guidelines, and expert training by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, to assist oncologists in making the best possible treatment decision for their patients.</p>

    <p>In this role I developed a robust subject matter experttise in oncology and designing for cognitive systems. I worked collaboratively with a team that fluctuated between 2-6 designers at a time (Design research, Visual design and UX design), as well as Offering management, Engineering teams, a Localization Design team in China, and more.</p>
        
    <p>As a UX designer, I've made sense of complex information architecture problems, iterated on interaction models, and assisted in conducting research locally and internationally to uncover user needs and market opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Watson for Clinical Trial Matching</h3>
        <p>Watson for Clinical Trial Matching is a tool that analyzes a patients medial record and diagnosis, and matches the patient with potential clinical trials. Along with researchers, we explored ways in which we could develop tools and workflows to aid clinical trial coordinators find the right candidates to fill trials. As part of this work, we were also tasked with prototyping how Watson for Clinical Trial Matching may integrate with Watson for Oncology to improve care coordination and ultimately, patient outcomes.</p>

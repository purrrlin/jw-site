    <h2> Designing a deployment console for smart-contract-powered distributed applications</h2></span>

    <span class="brief col-1">
        <h4>Problem/Opportunity</h4>
           <p> Digital Asset offers Daml, a platform for developing multi-party distributed applications. While developing 
               multiple proofs of concept for clients, and observing users getting started with the Daml platform, we found 
               a unique opportunity to provide a fully managed cloud environment to enable our customers to get to market much 
               quicker by skipping over having to construct and maintain their own infrastracture.</p>
            
          <h4>Solution:</h4>
          <p>A lean team was built internally to develop this idea. I helped drive a lot of the initial discussions to define 
              the target persona, and value proposition for this new project. Over time, I lead design for the information 
              architecture and user interface of the offering. I was able to work extremely closely with engineers and even 
              help with implementation and visual styling in code. Today, I continue to conduct research and iteration to 
              support the growth and evolution of the product in the market.</p>

        <h2> IBM Projects - Designing tools to aid healthcare providers make clinical decisions</h2></span>

    <span class="brief">
        <h3>Watson for Oncology</h3>
    <p>Watson for Oncology is a clinical decision support tool that aggregates and analyzes data from published medical literature, guidelines, and expert training by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, to assist oncologists in making the best possible treatment decision for their patients.</p>

    <p>In this role I developed a robust subject matter experttise in oncology and designing for cognitive systems. I worked collaboratively with a team that fluctuated between 2-6 designers at a time (Design research, Visual design and UX design), as well as Offering management, Engineering teams, a Localization Design team in China, and more.</p>
        
    <p>As a UX designer, I've made sense of complex information architecture problems, iterated on interaction models, and assisted in conducting research locally and internationally to uncover user needs and market opportunities.</p>
</span>

    <span class="brief-right">
        <h3>Watson for Clinical Trial Matching</h3>
        <p>Watson for Clinical Trial Matching is a tool that analyzes a patients medial record and diagnosis, and matches the patient with potential clinical trials. Along with researchers, we explored ways in which we could develop tools and workflows to aid clinical trial coordinators find the right candidates to fill trials. As part of this work, we were also tasked with prototyping how Watson for Clinical Trial Matching may integrate with Watson for Oncology to improve care coordination and ultimately, patient outcomes.</p>

        <p>I was selected to participate in a group of 6 IBMers being sent to Panam√° as part of the IBM Health Corps program. </p>
        <p>Our goal: Reduce the number and intensity of Zika and Dengue outbreaks by increasing the precision and quality of captured vector control data delivered on a common operational view that allows field and central public health officials to take action on new data within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>This project that I led design for was recognized as part of the Fast Company Innovation by Design Awards in 2017.</p>

    <p> Lootbox is a student project that aimed to solve the problem of scrap materials crowding the halls of our art school's buildings. 
        We created a system for re-purposing materials throughout the campus by setting designated boxes in the most scrap-heavy areas and 
        creating an app to showcase and find sought-after materials.</p>

    <p>Hexos IP is a B2C platform for small enterprises to renew their intelectual property.
